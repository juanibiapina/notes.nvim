INTRODUCTION						*notes-introduction*

This plugin provides functionality for note-taking in Neovim with support for:
- Opening links in Obsidian-style double brackets format `[[filename]]`
- Moving completed items to daily files (compatible with Obsidian daily notes)
- Creating and managing tasks with checkboxes
- Renaming notes and updating all references throughout the project

The plugin is written in Lua and exposes both commands and Lua functions for
programmatic access.

REQUIREMENTS						*notes-requirements*

ripgrep							*notes-ripgrep*
	Used for finding references to notes.
	
	Install ripgrep using your system package manager:
	- Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install ripgrep`
	- macOS with Homebrew: `brew install ripgrep`
	- Arch Linux: `pacman -S ripgrep`
	- Check https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep for more installation options.

CONFIGURATION						*notes-configuration*

						*g:notes_done_directory*
g:notes_done_directory	String (default: "daily/")
	Directory where daily files will be stored when completing items.
	Must end with a slash.

	Example: >
		let g:notes_done_directory = "completed/"
<

COMMANDS						*notes-commands*

:NotesOpen {filename}					*:NotesOpen*
	Open the specified file for editing. Automatically appends `.md` 
	extension if not already present. Creates the file with a header
	if it doesn't exist.
	
	Examples: >
		:NotesOpen myNote      " Opens myNote.md
		:NotesOpen file.md     " Opens file.md (unchanged)
<

:NotesOpenCurrent					*:NotesOpenCurrent*
	Opens a link based on the current cursor position:
	- If cursor is on an Obsidian-style link `[[filename]]`, opens that file
	- If multiple links exist on the line, opens the one under the cursor
	- Automatically appends `.md` extension to filenames
	- Does nothing if no Obsidian links are found

:NotesCompleteItem					*:NotesCompleteItem*
	Moves the current line to a daily file:
	- Creates file in format `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (or custom directory)
	- Appends current line to the daily file
	- Removes current line from original file
	- Compatible with Obsidian daily notes format

:NotesDailyToday					*:NotesDailyToday*
	Opens today's daily file:
	- Opens file in format `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
	- Creates the file with a header if it doesn't exist
	- Creates the daily directory if it doesn't exist
	- Compatible with Obsidian daily notes format

:NotesTaskNew						*:NotesTaskNew*
	Creates a new empty task on the next line:
	- Inserts `- [ ] ` on the line below the cursor
	- Positions cursor at the end for immediate editing
	- Works from any line in the buffer

:NotesTaskToggle					*:NotesTaskToggle*
	Toggles task completion status:
	- Changes `- [ ]` to `- [x]` (marks task as done)
	- Changes `- [x]` to `- [ ]` (marks task as not done)
	- Works with indented tasks
	- Does nothing if current line is not a task

:NotesMagic						*:NotesMagic*
	Smart command that behaves contextually based on cursor position:
	1. If cursor is on an Obsidian-style link `[[filename]]`, follows the link
	2. Otherwise, if current line is a task, toggles the task completion
	3. Otherwise, does nothing
	
	This command works well when assigned to a hotkey like "Enter" for
	context-aware note navigation and task management.

:NotesRename {new_title}				*:NotesRename*
	Rename the current note file, header and all references:
	- Renames the current note to the new title
	- Updates the header if it matches the old title
	- Finds and updates all Obsidian-style references `[[old_title]]` to `[[new_title]]`
	- Requires ripgrep
	- Prevents overwriting existing files
  - `.md` extension must not be included in the new title
	
	Examples: >
		:NotesRename "My New Title"    " Renames current note to "My New Title.md"
		:NotesRename new-note       " Renames to "new-note.md"
<

MAPPINGS						*notes-mappings*

The plugin does not set any default mappings. You can create your own: >

	" Example mappings using commands
	nmap <leader>no :NotesOpenCurrent<CR>
	nmap <leader>nc :NotesCompleteItem<CR>
	nmap <leader>nt :NotesTaskNew<CR>
	nmap <leader>ng :NotesTaskToggle<CR>
	nmap <CR> :NotesMagic<CR>

	" Example mappings using Lua functions
	nnoremap <leader>no <cmd>lua require('notes').open_current()<CR>
	nnoremap <leader>nc <cmd>lua require('notes').complete_item()<CR>
	nnoremap <leader>nt <cmd>lua require('notes').task_new()<CR>
	nnoremap <leader>ng <cmd>lua require('notes').task_toggle()<CR>
	nnoremap <CR> <cmd>lua require('notes').magic()<CR>
<

For backward compatibility, <Plug> mappings are still available: >
	" Legacy <Plug> mappings (still supported)
	nmap <leader>no <Plug>NotesOpenCurrent
	nmap <leader>nc <Plug>NotesCompleteItem
<

USAGE EXAMPLES						*notes-examples*

Opening links:
	Place cursor on any `[[filename]]` link and use `:NotesOpenCurrent`
	to open `filename.md`

Completing items:
	Place cursor on any line and use `:NotesCompleteItem` to move
	that line to today's daily file in the configured directory

Creating tasks:
	Use `:NotesTaskNew` to create a new task `- [ ] ` on the next line,
	with cursor positioned for immediate editing. The command automatically
	enters insert mode so you can start typing the task description.

Managing tasks:
	Place cursor on a task line and use `:NotesTaskToggle` to toggle
	between `- [ ]` (not done) and `- [x]` (done)

Smart context-aware command:
	Use `:NotesMagic` for context-aware behavior:
	- On `[[link]]`: follows the link
	- On `- [ ] task`: toggles task completion
	- Otherwise: does nothing
	
	Perfect for mapping to Enter key for intuitive navigation

Multiple links on one line:
	If a line contains `[[link1]] and [[link2]]`, the plugin will open
	the link where your cursor is positioned
