FUNCTIONS						*notes-functions*

The plugin provides two main functions accessible via <Plug> mappings:

<Plug>NotesOpenCurrent					*<Plug>NotesOpenCurrent*
	Opens a link or file based on the current cursor position:
	- If cursor is on an Obsidian-style link `[[filename]]`, opens that file
	- If multiple links exist on the line, opens the one under the cursor
	- If no links found but line starts with `- `, opens that as filename
	- Automatically appends `.md` extension to filenames

<Plug>NotesCompleteItem					*<Plug>NotesCompleteItem*
	Moves the current line to a daily file:
	- Creates file in format `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (or custom directory)
	- Appends current line to the daily file
	- Removes current line from original file
	- Compatible with Obsidian daily notes format

MAPPINGS						*notes-mappings*

The plugin does not set any default mappings. You can create your own: >

	" Example mappings
	nmap <leader>no <Plug>NotesOpenCurrent
	nmap <leader>nc <Plug>NotesCompleteItem
<

USAGE EXAMPLES						*notes-examples*

Opening links:
	Place cursor on any `[[filename]]` link and use <Plug>NotesOpenCurrent
	to open `filename.md`

Opening list items:
	Place cursor on a line like `- My Note Title` and use 
	<Plug>NotesOpenCurrent to open `My Note Title.md`

Completing items:
	Place cursor on any line and use <Plug>NotesCompleteItem to move
	that line to today's daily file in the configured directory

Multiple links on one line:
	If a line contains `[[link1]] and [[link2]]`, the plugin will open
	the link where your cursor is positioned
